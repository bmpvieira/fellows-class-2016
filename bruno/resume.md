#### PROJECTS
TITLE | TECH USED | LINK | DESCRIPTION
----- | --------- | ---- | ------------
Bionode.io | Node.JS / Bioinformatics | [LINK](http://bionode.io) | Community to build highly reusable tools and code for Bioinformatics using Node.JS
Zine about Open Science | Keynote / PDF  | [LINK](https://github.com/bmpvieira/fellows-class-2016/tree/master/bruno/Zine) | Idea started during fellowship onboarding and it was presented at MozFest 2016

I met with or made significant connections with the following organizations and people:

* Regular chats with [Repositive.io](http://repositive.io) about organising hackathons and how they can use Bionode.io
* Met James Littlejohn (he came to the Bionode workshop at MozFest 2016). He wants to use blockchain and peer to peer technology combined with Bionode.io and Bento.bio to organise a citizen science genomics study. See: http://dsensor.org and https://youtu.be/aLhVFYSVo4Y
* Met with Michael R. Crusoe and discussed how Bionode.io could use CWL
