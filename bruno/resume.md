## Networking
I met with or made significant connections with the following organizations and people:

* Regular chats with [Repositive.io](http://repositive.io) about organising hackathons and how they can use Bionode.io
* Met James Littlejohn (he came to the Bionode workshop at MozFest 2016). He wants to use blockchain and peer to peer technology combined with Bionode.io and Bento.bio to organise a citizen science genomics study. See: http://dsensor.org and https://youtu.be/aLhVFYSVo4Y
* Met with Michael R. Crusoe and discussed how Bionode.io could use CWL
* Got invited to teach Bionode to MSc student in U. Lisbon
* GSoC Student is in a lab that wants to use Bionode more (at Molecular Medicine Institute)


## Bionode
During my fellowship I learned how to better manage this community and what the funding landscape for open source projects like this looks like. I approached some funders and also attracted new contributors to this projects. We now need funding to support maintainers.

The following was developed during this fellowship:
* [Roadmap issue](https://github.com/bionode/bionode/issues/42)
* [Projects using Bionode](http://bionode.io/#Users)
* [Acknowledge all kinds of contributions](http://contributors.bionode.io)
* [Public organization wide project board](http://project.bionode.io)
* [Better contribution guidelines](https://github.com/bionode/bionode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/adopters/)
* [Blog](https://medium.com/@bionode)
* [Better Documentation](http://doc.bionode.io)
